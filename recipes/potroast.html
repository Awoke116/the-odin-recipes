     <h1>Pot Roast Recipe</h1>
     <p>This is the oven version of the recipe, that is, the original which I got from my mother. It is unbelievably delicious.</p>
     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
<li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
<li>1 (4 pound) beef pot roast</li>
<li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
<li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
<li>1 tablespoon dry mustard</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>

     </ul>
     <h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C)</li>
<li>Heat vegetable oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook beef in Dutch oven until browned on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side.</li>
<li>Mix brown sugar, salt, mustard, and black pepper together in a small bowl; sprinkle evenly over the roast. Arrange potatoes, carrots, and onion in the Dutch oven around the roast. Pour vinegar and water over the vegetables.</li>
<li>Place a cover on the Dutch oven and put in preheated oven. Cook until the roast is hot in the center, and just turning from pink to grey, about 4 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 150 degrees F (65 degrees C).</li>

</ol>
